<h3> <b>Wholehearted Youthfulness</b>
<br>
<br>
Decades of tapes in a closet, 
<br>
 Forgotten, dust-laden reels, 
<br>
As life tumbles forward, without pause.
<br>
<br>
The lip of your skin,veiled now—
<br>
I glimpse the tenderness of my own youth, 
<br>
Dripping softly from the corner of your eye
<br>
<br>
Soft skin beneath a lonesome blanket— 
<br>
I stand, trembling, trying to contain 
<br>
What once was uncontainable
<br>
<br>
I must.
<br>
Now.
<br>
But time is patient.
<br>
<br>
Yet there is a light—
<br>
Though I am blind,
<br>
I feel it warm the hollow of this heart.
<br>
<br>
And someday, when the moon learns to love again, 
<br>Perhaps I will, too.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
    <br>
    As you look into the eyes—
<br>
    blue and broken, eyes drowning in sadness so deep
<br>
    that words have no place, no purpose.
<br>
    What took over sits silent,
<br>
    <br>
those eyes cry out for you, endlessly.
<br>
    They weep through the night, flailing,
<br>
    hiding beneath the cold evening,
<br>
    until sleep falls on them—
<br>
   semi-golden, exhausted,
 <br>
    still trembling.
<br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
    The day I ventured to Eden, it was cold,
<br>
    cold and wet, the kind that sinks into your bones.
<br>
    I was tired when my visitor came,
<br>
    tired and buried beneath linen covers
<br>
    that the moonlight swept me under.
<br>
    <br>
    Unrecognizable, that face—
<br>
    the figure, the body towering over me.
<br>
    It was Thursday, I remember.
<br> A long, dark day that demanded nothing,
<br>
    yet still, I retired. No purpose behind it,
<br>
    just another wasted hour.
<br>
    <br>
    The figures it showed me were lost to reason,
<br>
    mere shadows, no value.
<br>
    The moon pressed into my chambers,
<br>
    thawing darkness whispered into my ear,
<br>
    and it hurt—knowing what I knew.
    <br>
<br>That your lifeless body poured herself a drink,
<br>I remembered; Your mouth opened,
<br> but neither I nor the moon listened.
<br> 
    <br>
    Euphoria struck at three o’clock—
<br>
   a sudden flood of bliss.
<br>
    <br> But it was dark, I remember. Cold and damp.
<br>
    You left that morning, and with you went my sanity.
<br>Incomprehensible were the words,
    <br> both then and now.
<br>
    <br>
    <hr>

    
    <br>
    <br>
    The journey was painful—
<br>
    facts, feats, and everything in between.
<br>
    Damp and wet, a place I had already seen.
<br>
    They say the West is best,
<br>
    but only for the sane.
    
<br>
    <br>
    Goodbyes are harder when you’re there to witness them,
<br>
    harder still when you’ve already left.
<br>
    Hermits, those who wander,
<br>
    will never understand.
<br>
    Knowledge holds the key,
<br>
    but the depths bring only madness.
<br>
    <br>
    It was cold and damp,
<br>
    cold and damp again.
<br>And on the floor, a pile of forgotten memories—
<br>discarded, soaked.
<br>
    Cold and damp,
<br>
    cold and damp,
<br>
    a rhythmic tapping on the thin glass window,
<br>
    permeable, fragile.
<br>
<br>
    <hr>
    <br>
<br>
    On the day I lost my mind,
<br>
    I made peace with my self-doubt.
<br>
The air hung cold, cool, and dusky,
<br>
    as I rose from my bed.
<br>
    Shadowy figures lingered at the edges,
<br>
    but none dared to approach.
<br>
    A whirlpool spun violently in the corner,
<br>
    pulling at the stillness.
<br>
    Then silence—
<br>
    until a screech tore through my ears.
<br>
    The blasphemous world crept closer,
<br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
        <br>
